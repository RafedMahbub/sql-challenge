# sql-challenge

#I used QUICKDBD (https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) for data modeling 
#then exporting the file gave us the table structure along with primary and foreign key.
#Used that to create the tables.

#I used Import function on PGAdmin to populate the tables and 
#finaly used sql query to analyse the data.
